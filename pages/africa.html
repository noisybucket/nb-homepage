<p>South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African continent, 
<br>marked by several distinct ecosystems. Inland safari destination Kruger National Park covers vast shrublands populated by big game;
<br>the Western Cape encompasses lush winelands around Stellenbosch and Paarl, wild beaches, 
<br>craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and lagoons along the Garden Route, 
<br>and the city of Cape Town, beneath flat-topped Table Mountain.</p>

<h1>REASONS</h1>
<p>The delightful things you've heard about French cuisine are all true: Sauces, cheeses, bread, champagne, pastries
<br>there's no end to what you can sample and where to enjoy it. If it's a beautiful day,start with a caf√©, 
<br>which you'll recognize by the rows 
of tables and chairs clustered outside its doors. 
<br>A village may have only one, while large cities have one every few meters. 
<br>A cup of coffee entitles you to sit and watch the passing parade for hours.
<br> In fact, you may have to nag a waiter to bring you a bill. If you want to see a dish before you eat it, head for a street market.</p>
