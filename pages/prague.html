<h1>PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC</h1>

	<p>Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. 
		<br>Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square,
		<br>the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, 
		<br>simply by placing a beer mat on the table? 
		And where that beer is probably the best in the world? 
		<br>But it's not just exquisite ale and a wonderfully relaxed drinking culture that keep bringing me back to Prague – 
		<br>there's wit and weirdness in equal measure: a public fountain where two figures pee in a 
		puddle, spelling out literary quotations; 
		<br>a 1950s nuclear bunker hidden beneath a city-centre hotel; and a cubist lamppost. Quirky doesn't even begin to describe it.</p>

	<h1>REASONS</h1>
	<p>How can you not love a city that has a pub with vinyl cushions on the wall above the gents' urinal, 
		<br>so you can rest your head while you 'go'? 
		Where you can order a beer without speaking, 
		<br>simply by placing a beer mat on the table? 
		And where that beer is probably the best in the world? 
		<br>But it's not just exquisite ale and a wonderfully relaxed drinking culture that keep bringing me back to Prague – 
		<br>there's wit and weirdness in equal measure: a public fountain where two figures pee in a 
		puddle, spelling out literary quotations; 
		<br>a 1950s nuclear bunker hidden beneath a city-centre hotel; and a cubist lamppost. Quirky doesn't even begin to describe it.</p>
