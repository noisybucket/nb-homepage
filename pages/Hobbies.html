   <h3>MY HOBBIES</h3>
   <p align="center">
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">A hobby is a special work which a person does for the sake of his amusement. It is our favourite recreation. A hobby is generally an art in which a person is most interested. A hobby to one may be a profession to other. It always serves as a source of recreation.
There are numerous hobbies. Some are fond of singing. Others like to draw pictures. Some collect stamps and old coins while others take interest in collecting poetry pieces or purchasing old books. The young are fond of playing outdoor games and visiting pictures. The old take delight in walking and gossiping. In short, there are as many hobbies as there are persons.</p>

	 <h3>CYCLING</h3>
	 <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">I love cycling because we can go on our cycle where we like. We need to roads for this purpose though roads we more suited to cycling. As we travel along on cycle, we enjoy fresh air. Outdoor life provides us many advantages. New scenes meet our eyes. Our mind is free from the serious thoughts. We forget bitterness of life so long as we are on the bicycle. Cycle is a boon to those who live in cities. They have many chances to enjoy the nature. They are quite strangers to the natural scenes. Many of them cannot go out of the town for many reasons. To these people the cycle is of great use. It enables them to go to the country. There they can enjoy beautiful scenes of nature.</p>

	 <h3>EATING</h3>
	 <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">I love food and love eating it, who doesn’t? When I am enjoying a meal I am thinking about the next one. I don’t know why but one of my favorite things to do is eating out. I have a passion for food and want to be a cook when I grow up. My inspiration is definitely my grandma taking me out to eat and letting me help her cook on holidays. When I am cooking food over the stove I love the smell of it rising into my nose.</p>

	 <h3>PLAYING VOLLEYBALL</h3>
	 <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">The complete rules are extensive. But simply, play proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to 3 times but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively. Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack, an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the serving team is unable to prevent it from being grounded in their court.</p>
