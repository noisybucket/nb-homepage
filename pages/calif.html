<p>California, a western U.S. state, stretches from the Mexican border along the Pacific for nearly 900 miles.
<br>It's known for its dramatic terrain encompassing cliff-lined beaches, redwood forest, 
<br>the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Central Valley farmland and the arid Mojave Desert.
<br>Its cities include sprawling Los Angeles, seat of the Hollywood entertainment industry, 
<br>and hilly San Francisco, home to the Golden Gate Bridge.

<h1>REASONS</h1>
<p>The delightful things you've heard about French cuisine are all true: Sauces, cheeses, bread, champagne, pastries
<br>there's no end to what you can sample and where to enjoy it. If it's a beautiful day,start with a caf√©, 
<br>which you'll recognize by the rows 
of tables and chairs clustered outside its doors. 
<br>A village may have only one, while large cities have one every few meters. 
<br>A cup of coffee entitles you to sit and watch the passing parade for hours.
<br> In fact, you may have to nag a waiter to bring you a bill. If you want to see a dish before you eat it, head for a street market.</p>
