<p>France, in Western Europe, encompasses medieval and port cities, tranquil villages, mountains and Mediterranean beaches. 
<br>Paris, its capital, is known worldwide for its couture fashion houses, classical art museums including the Louvre and monuments like the Eiffel Tower. 
<br>The country is also renowned for its sophisticated cuisine and its wines.
<br> Lascaux's ancient cave drawings, Lyon's Roman theater and the immense Palace of Versailles are testaments to its long history.</p>

<h1>REASONS</h1>
<p>The delightful things you've heard about French cuisine are all true: Sauces, cheeses, bread, champagne, pastries
<br>there's no end to what you can sample and where to enjoy it. If it's a beautiful day,start with a caf√©, 
<br>which you'll recognize by the rows 
of tables and chairs clustered outside its doors. 
<br>A village may have only one, while large cities have one every few meters. 
<br>A cup of coffee entitles you to sit and watch the passing parade for hours.
<br> In fact, you may have to nag a waiter to bring you a bill. If you want to see a dish before you eat it, head for a street market.</p>
