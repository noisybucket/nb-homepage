	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;"><sup>[1]</sup>I remember it like it was yesterday.<sup>[2]</sup>When I was a child the world seemed to be a place of joy and happiness to me.  
<sup>[3]</sup>I was sent to school at the early age of 3 when my mother knew that I could already write and read.  
<sup>[4]</sup>I was sent to school at a very young age but I think the child version of me didn't mind. 
<sup>[5]</sup>I remember that I really like my school because everything a child would want was there. 
<sup>[6]</sup>There's story books, TV, toys, and a lot more. <sup>[7]</sup>I remeber wanting to hold those things. 
<sup>[8]</sup>I graduated preschool at the age of 5 and I started attending elementary school at the age of 6.  
<sup>[9]</sup>I was unwilling to get up early in the morning and go to school. 
<sup>[10]</sup>But as I was interested in my studies, I enjoyed going to school.  <sup>[11]</sup>In the afternoon, we played all sorts of games and pranks in the street.  <sup>[12]</sup>Childhood is free from cares.  <sup>[13]</sup>There are no duties and responsibilities in the shoulders of a child.  <sup>[14]</sup>A child eats, drinks, sleeps and plays.  <sup>[15]</sup>The memory of these good days makes me happy.</p><br>

	<h3 id="Teenage Years">Teenage Years</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;"><sup>[1]</sup>During teenage years is where you experience it all. <sup>[2]</sup>I strongly believe that high school is the open door, into the rest of my life. <sup>[3]</sup>Irememeber my first days of high school. <sup>[4]</sup>I was just dying to experience all the new and exciting that awaited me. <sup>[5]</sup>From sports to boys to all the partying, I just wanted to know what everything  was like. 
	<sup>[6]</sup>Now that I've done all those things and many more, some say that "high school was the best time of my life", just like others say that high school was the worst timr of their lives. <sup>[7]</sup>To be honest, I am not sure which category I fall into. <sup>[8]</sup>I've had plenty of good times, as well as just as many as bad times, in high school. <sup>[9]</sup>The only thing I can say is that I learned. <sup>[10]</sup>And the most important thing is that, not just that I learned through the books, but I learned about life and the road ahead of me.</p><br>

	<!--College-->
	
	<h3 id="College Years">College Years</h3>
	
	<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;"><sup>[1]</sup>College is a lot different than high school. <sup>[2]</sup>It acquires more work, more discipline, more time, and more resppnsibility and that is why I like going to college. <sup>[3]</sup>I'd say that for the time being college has made me into a better person. <sup>[4]</sup>It made me more mature and more responsible. <sup>[5]</sup>During my freshmen year, I wasn't excited nor scared to take one big step inside of what was going to be my future. \
	<sup>[6]</sup>Then the classes started, I don't know anyone that day so I was nervous. <sup>[7]</sup>And I was hoping to have a friend to be with me in our finding our classes, and then I met one. <sup>[8]</sup>Then came our break time, I met more friends that day and I was happy that I have met them. <sup>[9]</sup>I was overwhelmed that day and it made me excited to go to school everyday, wondering what will we learn, what will we discover, will I make new friends. <sup>[10]</sup>I think college could be fun, stressful, heart breaking, but its mostly amazing.</p><br>
