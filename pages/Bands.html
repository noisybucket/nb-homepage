	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">Food not only distinguishes and represents a culture, but can also reflect one's personality, lifestyle, and socio-economic status. Philippines is made up of every kind of culture, nationality, and custom. Because Philippines is composed of immigrants and descendants of immigrants, there is no real "Philippine cuisine,  only Philippinized cuisine and a multitude of cuisines taken from various cultures. The diversity that makes up Philippines' cuisine is as varied as the diversity that makes up Philippines. 
	Although I enjoy almost every type of food, I am partial to Philippine food, the cuisine of my native land. One of my three favorite dishes are Sinigang, which is a either pork, shrimp, fish etc.,it is often seasoned with tamarind or miso.vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (gabi), daikon (labanós), water spinach (kangkóng), yardlong beans (sitaw) and eggplant (talóng). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with green long peppers in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish.</p>
