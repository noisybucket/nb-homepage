  <h3>BOOKS</h3>
	<p align="center">
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">Books are our best friends, guiders and philosophers. Books uphold and encourage us when we feel sad and despondent. They bring light into darkness and the sunshine into shadow.When you read a book, its feels great to put yourself into a world the writer has created for you.The habit of reading good content daily will act as an exercise for your mind and keep you mentally fit and flexible. Reading a book is not like that you read a book in English,that is in any language which you feel comfortable. If you have never given it a try then always remember that itâ€™s never too late to start a good habit</p>

	 <h4>A Song of Ice and Fire Series by George R.R Martin</h4>
	</center>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.</p>

	<h4>Ready Player One by Ernest Cline</h4>
	</center>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;">In the year 2044, the world is gripped by an energy crisis causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for most people is the OASIS, a virtual universe, accessed with a visor and haptic gloves. It functions both as an MMORPG and as a virtual society, with its currency being the most stable currency in the world. It was created by James Halliday, whose will left a series of clues towards an Easter Egg within the OASIS that would grant whoever found it both his fortune and control of the OASIS itself. This has led to an intense interest in all aspects of 80s pop culture, which Halliday made clear would be essential to finding his egg.</p>

	<h4>The Fault In Our Stars by John Green</h4>
	</center>
		<p style="text-align:justify; font-family:Segoe UI Light; font-size:1.2em;"> Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs, attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. During the support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year old boy named Augustus Waters, whose Osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.</p><br>
